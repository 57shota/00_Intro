## Prologue
This is the memo and evidence of the imitated project called “The Create As Many Shitty Apps As Likes” based on [this article](https://www.yukisako.xyz/entry/swift-kusoapps-summery)(Japanese). The main purpose is to understand and improve coding skills with Swift.
I have collected likes on instagram and facebook for a hour.

Results
IG 31 likes + FB 4 likes = 35 likes

Therefore I’m going to create 35 apps in total.

I forgot to take a screenshot of facebook likes as of 4 likes.
At the end, I have got 70 likes (23, Sep 2018), it was about to kill me…

## Conditions on the project
There is no meaning to create them lazily, in addition I can’t neglect to be a student and work to earn my tuition fee, so I’m using “5 hours limit” for each app as a reference, which the writer on the original project have used.
Maybe this condition might be changeable depending on my experience as this project goes. However, the plan at this moment is to create 2 apps in a week, which makes about 4 months to complete. It might be a too slow pace but it could also change depending on my school and work schedules.

## Summary
- To create 35 apps
- 5 hours for each app 
- To accomplish at least 2 apps in a week (could be 3 or more depending on my lifecycle) 
- Do not too much cling to quality or design. Just pursue “shitty”.
- To make it public anyway after I create for each app (IG / TW / FB) 
- To upload codes after the completion of the project to save time. (or perhaps I might as well upload some of them…)
- Have a fun
</br>


As you see, most of them are not the immutable variables but let’s have a fun focusing on a completion not to attempt to create “cool apps”.
I’m going to upload Japanese on Qiita and English on Github.

Thanks
